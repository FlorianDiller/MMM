\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}What is Martial Mutant Misfitz?}
\normalfont\large You are humanoid animal mutants. Human society rejects you. Your appearance is alien and off-putting to most humans. Fortunately, a mentor came into your life. Taking care of you when you needed it the most. Training you in martial prowess, and teaching you how to leverage your new abilities. A mentor hiding your from society and shielding you from harm. But this could soon end, as a new evil rises, that threatens the city. Who is gonna stop it? Who if not you?!\\
\medskip
Martial Mutant Misfitz is a game about teenagers mutated into whacky humanoid animals. It's a game about fighting with style and Kung Fu. It also is a game about being an outsider --- the feeling of not fitting into society. And lastly, it's a game about family and finding this feeling of belonging there.

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Basic Moves}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Kick Ass!}
When you fight a foe, roll +Grit.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{10+} -- You deal harm and avoid harm.
    \item \textbf{7-9} -- Trade harm.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Talk the Talk}
When you persuade, bluff, or drop a catchphrase, roll +Wits.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{10+} -- They go along with it — at least for now.
    \item \textbf{7-9} -- They want something in return or remain suspicious.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Ride or Slide}
When you pull off a stunt or escape using vehicles, skates, or agility, roll +Style. On a 10+ choose one from below. On a 7-9 choose one from below, but you get a condition.
\begin{itemize}
    \item You impress someone.
    \item You get +1 forward.
    \item A teammate gets +1 forward.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Team Up!}
When you assist a teammate, combine powers, or do a signature team move, roll +Discipline.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{10+} -- Perfect combo! Your teammate gets +1 forward.
    \item \textbf{7-9} -- Your teammate gets +1 forward, but you get a condition.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Blend In}
When you try not to draw attention, roll + Style. On a 10+ you blend in. On a 7-9 choose one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Somebody gets suspicious.
    \item You draw a lot of attention.
    \item You stick out like a sore thumb.
    \item You make it but get a condition.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Always a Little Smarter}
When you try to find out what's going on, roll +Wits. On a 10+ the GM answers you two, on a 7-9 one, of the questions below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What happened here?
    \item What sort of enemy are we dealing with here?
    \item What can it do?
    \item Where did it go?
    \item What was it up to?
    \item What is being concealed here?
\end{itemize}
On a miss, you reveal some information to your enemy. The GM might ask you questions.\\
It is important, that your investigations and their results are plausible and consistent with what's happening. The GM might ask you "How do you find that out?". If you don't have a good answer, choose another question instead.

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Hideout Moves}
\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Training Montage}
When you train with your mentor, explain how and in what discipline roll +Discipline. On a 10+ you impress your mentor and get +1 forward. On a 7-9 choose one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Play out one of your flipsides.
    \item Take a condition.
    \item Explain how you disappoint your master.
\end{itemize}

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Running the game}
\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Game structure}
The structure of the game is seperated in to phases that correspond each to a different scenery.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inside -- Hideout: Training, Planning, Discussing, Family, Mentor
    \item Outside -- The City: Fighting, Investigating, Action
\end{itemize}
In the hideout, the team interacts predominantly with one another and their mentor. Often, this represents a good opportunity to play out the \emph{Leading Principles} of the playbook. The mentor represents a useful narrative tool to you as a GM. Use him to steer the mutants in certain directions: Give them adventure hooks, send them out, be emotional, treat them like your children, allow them things, forbid them others.\\
\medskip
The session is usually best ended by the team having their favoutire junk food in their hideout. Don't forget the cliffhangers, tho! A cut to the evil guy does wonders.\\
\medskip
Like other games, Martial Mutant Misfitz can be a bit more fun, when you try to treat it like a series: Look for a theme song and play it in the beginning. Probably your game will take food, cigarette or toilet breaks. Try to transition back in with some fun advertisement. For example, narrate a 90s action figure commercial for the player character. Ask them details about the ad and the figure. Cereal commercials are great, too! Depending on your players you can also let them do the narration.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}GM Moves}
The GM has a seperate set of rules. They mostly come in play, when a player rolls a 6 or lower. There isn't necessarily a rule which of these moves has to be taken, except for "follow the narration".
\begin{itemize}
    \item Separate them
    \item Shift the odds.
    \item Reveal future badness (something is building up).
    \item Reveal off-screen badness (sirens, smoke, TV, radio, …).
    \item Make them pay a price.
    \item Activate their stuffs' downside.
    \item Capture someone.
    \item Tell them the possible consequences and ask if they want to go ahead.
    \item Turn their move back on them.
    \item Offer an opportunity, maybe with a cost.
    \item Put someone in trouble.
    \item After every move, ask what they do next.
    \item Inflict harm or condition.
    \item Make them trade.
    \item Take away some of the mutants' stuff.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Agenda}
There are certain rules, that everyone at the table agrees to follow. Some points to flavor the play, form the world and help make decisions. Additionally to the Agenda, every playbook has their Leading Principles, which should help the players roleplay their character.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the world seem real.
    \item Play to see what happens.
    \item Make the mutants' lives chaotic and rad.
    \item Portrait the life of teenage outsiders.
\end{itemize}
