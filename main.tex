\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}What is Martial Mutant Misfitz?}
\normalfont\large You are anthropomorphic animal mutants. Human society rejects you. Your appearance is alien and off-putting to most humans. Fortunately, a mentor came into your life. Taking care of you when you needed it the most. Training you in martial prowess, and teaching you how to leverage your new abilities. A mentor hiding your from society and shielding you from harm. But this could soon end, as a new evil rises, that threatens the city. Who is gonna stop it? Who if not you?!\\
\medskip
Martial Mutant Misfitz is a game about teenagers mutated into whacky humanoid animals. It's a game about fighting with style and Kung Fu. It also is a game about being an outsider --- the feeling of not fitting into society. And lastly, it's a game about family and finding this feeling of belonging there.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Motifs}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}This game was inspired by the following systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Apocalypse World} by D. Vincent Baker \& Meguey Baker
    \item \textbf{Dungeon World} by Sage LaTorra \& Adam Koebel
    \item \textbf{Fate} by Leonard Balsera, Fred Hicks \& Rob Donoghue

    \item \textbf{Monsterhearts} by Avery Alder
    \item \textbf{Monster of the Week} by Michael Sands \& Steve Hickey
\end{itemize}

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}How to Play?}
\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Tools}
To play the game you will need:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Yourself and 2 to 5 other players
    \item Minimum a pair of six-sided dice, better one pair for each player
    \item A cheat sheet for each player and for you
    \item Each of the playbooks you want to allow for your play
    \item The team playbook
    \item The evil book
    \item Pencils and erasers
    \item Additional paper for Notes
    \item Index cards for character / player names
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Fiction First}
This system follows the tradition of other PbtA systems, when putting fiction first.
Consequently, players describe what they want to do, not which mechanical move they want to roll for.
This can be hard for some players, especially when coming from other, more crunchy systems.
To help facilitate a narrative first game style, the GM usually asks a lot of questions: "What are you doing?", "How are you doing this?", "What does it look like?", etc.
Not only questions regarding the course of actions are asked that way, but also regarding background and lore of the story.
This should facilitate a cooperative storytelling and craft a story that has a bit of everybody at the table in it.

The GM does not roll, but acts when a player receives consequences and partial successes through a roll.
This could be offering a choice of two outcomes, advancing the evil, etc.
For more information, see \autoref{sec:GMmoves}.
It is also the GMs responsibility setting up and ending scenes to facilitate an action-packed adventure.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Playbooks}
As many other PbtA games, Martial Mutant Misfitz relies on playbooks. Meaning that every character has an extended character sheet, giving them all information they need for playing said character.
Usually, the system and narrative works best when each playbook is unique.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Moves}
There are three categories of moves: Basic Moves, Hideout Moves and Playbook moves.

The Basic Moves and Hideout Moves can be done by everybody.
The Hideout Moves can be only done in the Hideout.
Playbook moves are special to the character of the playbook, but through advancement moves from other playbooks can be acquired.
Each move usually has a stat corresponding to it, that is added after you roll.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Stats}
In Martial Mutant Misfitz, there are four stats: Grit, Discipline, Style, and Wits. They each represent different aspects of each mutant:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Grit:} Pushing through, showing strength, fighting
    \item \textbf{Discipline:} Focussing, working in a team, being calm
    \item \textbf{Style:} Doing something cool, saying a rad one-liner, making a stunt
    \item \textbf{Wits:} Being smart, analyzing, conversation
\end{itemize}


\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Rolling}
Players roll, the GM never rolls.
When a player is asked to roll, they roll two six-sided dice.
Normally a Stat is added and sometimes equipments or conditions, that apply.
The result is divided in three ranges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 10+ -- A success without drawbacks. The character achieves what they tried without consequences.
    \item 7-9 -- Success with a drawback or partial success. What the character tried to do is only partially achieved or comes with consequences.
    \item 6- -- A miss. You mark experience / advancement. This does not always mean that the character misses in the narrative. But it probably will come with grave consequences. These are explained by the GM and normally taken from the GM move list.
\end{itemize}
Analogically to a 6- being referred to as a miss, sometimes a 7+ is referred to as a hit.


\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Conditions}
There are 5 conditions, one corresponding to each stat and Poisoned, that affects all stats.
Conditions are usually acquired when botching a roll.
They can be cleared when playing out a flipside of your characters leading principles, or when they are narratively gotten rid of.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Starting the Game}
Usually, it's best to begin with a strong start.
As described in \autoref{sec:atmosphere}, it is recommended to play an intro, where each character introduces himself, to emulate a cartoon.
Afterwards, it can be helpful to jump right into the action by describing an engaging parkour or chasing scene.
Another variant could be starting in the hideout, after playing the intro and introducing some sort of danger to the city via TV, radio, internet, etc.
Use the mentor to invoke a sense of urgency.
Depending on what mentor you chose or rolled, you can have a sentimental moment seperating from your mentees.
If you don't play a hideout scene, where each character has the opportunity to play out their leading principles, start with +2 Team Mojo.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Ending the Session}
For a session end, wether it's a one shot or part of a campaign, it is recommended to end with a cliffhanger.
What happened in the session and the evil you fleshed out earlier, should give you good ideas how the big baddie could react to the actions of the players or some small hint that evil might not be extinguished after all.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Advancement}
Each time a roll equals a 6 or below (i.e. miss), the player can mark off experience.
When 5 experience are marked, erase all experience marks, and choose an advancement from the list below.

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Basic Moves}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Kick Ass!}
When you fight a foe, roll +Grit.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{10+} -- You deal harm and avoid harm.
    \item \textbf{7-9} -- Trade harm.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Defy Danger}

    \item Dodging, +Discipline
    \item Quick thinking, +Wits
    \item Doing a stunt, +Style

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Talk the Talk}
When you persuade, bluff, or drop a catchphrase, roll +Wits.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{10+} -- They go along with it â€” at least for now.
    \item \textbf{7-9} -- They want something in return or remain suspicious.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Radical Escape}
When you pull off a stunt or escape using vehicles, skates, or agility, roll +Style. On a 10+ choose one from below. On a 7-9 choose one from below, but you get a condition.

    \item A teammate gets +1 forward.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Team Up!}
When you assist a teammate, combine your powers, or do a signature team move, roll +Discipline. On a hit, choose one of the following according to the narrative:
\begin{itemize}
    \item You helped them, they get +1 forward.
    \item You both deal harm.
\end{itemize}
On a 7-9 you sacrifice something for the move: Positioning, ressources or concentration. 

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Blend In}
When you try not to draw attention, roll + Style. On a 10+ you blend in. On a 7-9 choose one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Somebody gets suspicious.
    \item You draw a lot of attention.
    \item You stick out like a sore thumb.
    \item You make it but get a condition.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Always a Little Smarter}
When you try to find out what's going on, roll +Wits. On a 10+ the GM answers you two, on a 7-9 one of the questions below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What happened here?
    \item What sort of enemy are we dealing with here?
    \item What can it do?
    \item Where did it go?
    \item What was it up to?
    \item What is being concealed here?
\end{itemize}
On a miss, you reveal some information to your enemy. The GM might ask you questions.\\
It is important, that your investigations and their results are plausible and consistent with what's happening. The GM might ask you "How do you find that out?". If you don't have a good answer, choose another question instead.

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Hideout Moves}
\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Training Montage}

%Lieber wÃ¼rfeln?

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Always a Little Smarter}
When you try to find out what's going on, roll +Wits. On a 10+ the GM answers you two, on a 7-9 one of the questions below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do we get in?
    \item How do we get out?
    \item What is a secret?
    \item In which area is the target?
    \item What danger we are likely to face?
\end{itemize}
On a miss, the target moves, information was wrong or an obstacles surfaces.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Let's Roll!}
When you move out of the hideout to go on a mission, roll. Add +1 for everything that gives you an advantage for this mission -- information, gear, contacts, etc.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{10+} -- You are in a controlled situation when the action starts.
    \item \textbf{7-9} -- You are in a risky situation when the action starts.
    \item \textbf{6-} -- You are in a desperate situation when the action starts.
\end{itemize}

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Running the Game}
\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Game Structure}
The structure of the game is seperated in to phases that correspond each to a different scenery.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inside -- Hideout: Training, Planning, Discussing, Family, Mentor
    \item Outside -- The City: Fighting, Investigating, Action
\end{itemize}
In the hideout, the team interacts predominantly with one another and their mentor. Often, this represents a good opportunity to play out the \emph{Leading Principles} of the playbook. The mentor represents a useful narrative tool to you as a GM. Use him to steer the mutants in certain directions: Give them adventure hooks, send them out, be emotional, treat them like your children, allow them things, forbid them others.\\
\medskip
The session is usually best ended by the team having their favoutire junk food in their hideout. Don't forget the cliffhangers, tho! A cut to the evil guy does wonders.\\
\medskip
Like other games, Martial Mutant Misfitz can be a bit more fun, when you try to treat it like a series: Look for a theme song and play it in the beginning. Probably your game will take food, cigarette or toilet breaks. Try to transition back in with some fun advertisement. For example, narrate a 90s action figure commercial for the player character. Ask them details about the ad and the figure. Cereal commercials are great, too! Depending on your players you can also let them do the narration.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Gamemaster Moves \label{sec:GMmoves}}
The GM has a seperate set of rules. They mostly come in play, when a player rolls a 6 or lower. There isn't necessarily a rule which of these moves has to be taken, except for "follow the narration".
\begin{itemize}
    \item Separate them.
    \item Shift the odds.
    \item Reveal future badness (something is building up).
    \item Reveal off-screen badness (sirens, smoke, TV, radio, â€¦).
    \item Make them pay a price.
    \item Activate their stuffs' downside.
    \item Capture someone.
    \item Tell them the possible consequences and ask if they want to go ahead.
    \item Turn their move back on them.
    \item Offer an opportunity, maybe with a cost.
    \item Put someone in trouble.
    \item After every move, ask what they do next.
    \item Inflict harm or condition.
    \item Make them trade.
    \item Take away some of the mutants' stuff.
    \item Decrease the Team Mojo.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Agenda}
There are certain rules, that everyone at the table agrees to follow. Some points to flavor the play, form the world and help make decisions. Additionally to the Agenda, every playbook has their Leading Principles, which should help the players roleplay their character.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the world seem real.
    \item Play to see what happens.
    \item Make the mutants' lives chaotic and rad.
    \item Portrait the life of teenage outsiders.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Team Mojo}
The Team Mojo describes the coherence of the Team. Depending on the team coherence, assisting other team members, combining powers or team moves are becoming easier or harder. The Team Mojo ranges from -3 to 3. If the Team Mojo would be added while on 3, the player gets +1 forward. If the Team Mojo would be decreased under -3 a Team Rift occurs.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Team Rift}
When the Team Mojo falls under -3, the team coherence is shattered. Nothing is coordinated and the team is being torn apart. This should have drastic consequences for the team in the narrative, such as being captured, seperated or worse.

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Gamemasters Section}
\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Hideout vs. Action Dynamic}
Use mentor for plot hooks and pushing them, use mentor to engage a talk in the hideout -- using leading principles etc.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Setting the Scene \label{sec:atmosphere}}
To set the scene, try to invoke the feeling of a 90s action cartoon. That is being best done while describe the intro of your cartoon. When playing the first session or one shots, begin by playing a prepared rock song (Paul Gilbert - Down to Mexico is great for something like this) and start describing the logo of the cartoon and actions they take together. The intro then shows typical scenes in the lifes of each character. Go around the table and let each player introduce their character with a typical cartoon scene. When playing further sessions, you can let one, some, or all players describe some "last episode on"-bit.

This can be expanded on by describing to commercial breaks (normally in combination with cliffhangers in the session / episode). The GM should set an example by explaining the first commercial. The themes usually follow commercial in kids programs: Action figures, sweets, drinks, toys, etc. Afterwards, the GM can then ask if somebody has an idea for a commercial, prompt them to do a commercial, or ask what a commercial for an action figure of their character would look like.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Difficulty}
When starting out, it can be hard as a GM to estimate the level of difficulty in combat. In PbtA games, it is possible to zoom in or out of the action. Combat can be just a single Kick Ass! roll or multiple ones. Misses and mixed results don't always have to come with harm dealt as a consequence. It could also be that the players get into worse situations or lose ressources. Ensure to make use of all the Gamemaster Moves, especially in Combat. The weird and whacky scenario of odd mutations and crazy science-driven technology can result in all kinds of wild twists in combat. Maybe the enemy spontaneously mutates further or pulls out a technological device, that fits just the situation.

A strategy to raise difficulty for the players in combat is to layer rolls. If a player tries to fight an enemy with electrical nunchakus, you could ask for a single Kick Ass! check or for a Deny Danger check first. Layering rolls like this zooms in on the action and raises the difficulty.
% See the dungeon world guide section for this and add a similar example here

\chapter*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Create a Game}
\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Explain the Basics}
When you start a game of Manic Mutant Misfitz, start by explaining the game basics, the roles of players and GM and how your roll for your actions.
Explain the motifs and dynamics of the games and how scenes are set.
Mention and explain the agenda.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Choose your Playbooks}
Distribute the playbooks to each player evenly and read the descriptions on the front one by one.
Go ahead and choose your playbooks.
Each playbook is usually unique.
Roll or choose your animal, names.
Read out your leading principles and flipsides.
Fill out the relations and let the players tell small stories about it.
Ask questions to flesh out the stories and the characters.
Ask about what it is like to be a mutant of that animal.
What abilities and quirks carry over to everyday life?

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Sketch the Setting}
Create the setting by filling out the teambook together.
As a GM try to flesh out the setting by always asking questions.
It is possible to roll for each of the setting aspects, but do not feel obliged to do so.
Rather ask questions to the players and decide as a group what is most fun and fits the narrative.
However, it is advised to fill out each of the aspects before playing.

Similarly, roll or choose the aspects of evil to flesh it out.
You can do this in secret as GM to give the players the opportunity to find out what kind of evil they are facing or fill it out together.
This could to a different kind of game, where sketching the evil together leads to a more action-focussed game and keeping it hidden could develop a mystery type of game, where players have to investigate more.

You can at this point fill some gaps in the backgrounds.
Do not feel obliged to have bulletboof backgrounds and reasoning.
Everything can be flesh out during play.

\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}Moves, Stats and Equipment}
Explain how the players roll and what your function is as a GM while rolling.
Describe the basic moves and their outcomes.
Explain the stats and how they interact with moves.
Choose your equipment and set your moves and stats.
Explain how advancements work.
