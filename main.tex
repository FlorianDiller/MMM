\section*{\fontspec{TradeWinds-Regular.ttf}What is Martial Mutant Misfitz?}
\normalfont\normalsize You are humanoid animal mutants. Human society rejects you. Your appearance is alien and off-putting to most humans. Fortunately, a mentor came into your life. Taking care of you when you needed it the most. Training you in martial prowess, and teaching you how to leverage your new abilities. A mentor hiding your from society and shielding you from harm. But this could soon end, as a new evil rises, that threatens the city. Who is gonna stop it? Who if not you?!

Martial Mutant Misfitz is a game about whacky teenagers mutated into animals. It's a game about stylish fighting and kung fu. It also is a game about being an outsider --- he feeling of not fitting into society. And lastly, it's a game about family.
